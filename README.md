# X-UNS Bug Tracker

This is the bug tracker for x-uns (UNS-1 FMS simulation for X-Plane 11). If you have encountered
a bug, crash or oddity using the FMS, please report it here by clicking on [issues](issues), and
creating a new report.

**Please make sure to include a log with any report (preferably, the `uns1_log.txt` file present
in your main X-Plane folder), as well as a detailed description of what happened and what went
wrong. Any additional info is helpful (screenshots, etc).**
